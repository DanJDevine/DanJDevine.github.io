### It's a bit like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee), except it took me a day to make.

Alongside web pages we *have* to provide, like ORCID and institution pages, there's also some that are useful to have, like personal websites and Google Scholar. But that's a lot of websites and chances are at least half are going to be out of date. 

I made this website as a sort of `directory' to keep track of all those links and order them by how out of date they're going to be.
